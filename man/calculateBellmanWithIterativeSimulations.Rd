\title{Calculate Bellman values throughout iterations of Antares simulation and DP
Each simulation leads to a new reward estimation, which leads to new water values,
which leads to the off-line calculation in R of an optimal trajectory, which leads to
new controls to be evaluated which leads to a new simulation}

# Create a data frame with all possible transition and associated next state for each scenario and each state for one particular week, used in `Bellman`. For each next state, Bellman value is calculated.

Create a data frame with all possible transition and associated next
state for each scenario and each state for one particular week, used in
`Bellman`. For each next state, Bellman value is calculated.

## Usage

``` r
build_all_possible_decisions(
  Data_week,
  decision_space,
  f_next_value,
  mcyears,
  lvl_high,
  lvl_low,
  E_max,
  P_max,
  next_week_values,
  niveau_max,
  overflow_cost,
  next_states
)
```

## Arguments

- Data_week:

  Data frame generated in `Grid_Matrix` code containing list of states
  and years evaluated (we suppose there is only one week at a time) as
  weel as inflows

- decision_space:

  Simulation constraints values for the week generated by `get_Reward`
  or `runWaterValuesSimulation`

- f_next_value:

  List of approximated Bellman functions for the next week, generated by
  `get_bellman_values_interpolation`

- mcyears:

  Vector of monte carlo years to take into account

- lvl_high:

  Double, top rule curve for the end of the week in MWh

- lvl_low:

  Double, bottom rule curve for the end of the week in MWh

- E_max:

  Double, weekly maximum turbining power for the week

- P_max:

  Double, weekly maximum pumping power for the week

- next_week_values:

  Vector of Bellman values for the next week

- niveau_max:

  Reservoir capacity in MWh

- overflow_cost:

  Cost for overflow (equal to spillage cost of the area)

- next_states:

  possible states for next week

## Value

Data frame with same format as Data week with 3 more columns :
next_state, control (transition to next state) and next value (Bellman
value of next state)

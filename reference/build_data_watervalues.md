# Calculate and plot watervalues with `value_node_gen`. Penalties taken into account. Used in `Grid_Matrix`

Calculate and plot watervalues with `value_node_gen`. Penalties taken
into account. Used in `Grid_Matrix`

## Usage

``` r
build_data_watervalues(
  watervalues,
  statesdt,
  reservoir,
  penalty_level_high,
  penalty_level_low,
  force_final_level = FALSE,
  penalty_final_level_low = 0,
  penalty_final_level_high = 0,
  final_level = NULL,
  plot_watervalues = T
)
```

## Arguments

- watervalues:

  Data frame generated in `Grid_Matrix`

- statesdt:

  Data frame of possible states, generated in `Grid_Matrix`

- reservoir:

  Data frame describing rule curves, generated by `readReservoirLevels`

- penalty_level_high:

  Penalty for violating the bottom rule curve

- penalty_level_low:

  Penalty for violating the top rule curve

- force_final_level:

  Binary. Whether final level should be constrained

- penalty_final_level_low:

  Penalties for both bottom rule curve to constrain final level

- penalty_final_level_high:

  Penalties for top rule curve to constrain final level

- final_level:

  Double. Final level to consider

- plot_watervalues:

  Binary. Plot watervalues or not ?

## Value

Data frame with water value (vu) for each week (weeks) and each state
(states). vu_pen corresponds to water value without penalties

# Generate constraint values for a week at a time used in `constraint_generator` depending on the maximum powers for the week

Generate constraint values for a week at a time used in
`constraint_generator` depending on the maximum powers for the week

## Usage

``` r
constraint_week(
  pumping,
  efficiency,
  nb_disc_stock,
  reservoir_capacity,
  hydro,
  week
)
```

## Arguments

- pumping:

  Boolean. True to take into account the pumping.

- efficiency:

  between 0 and 1. the pumping efficiency ratio.

- nb_disc_stock:

  Number of constraint values wanted for each week

- reservoir_capacity:

  Double, reservoir capacity

- hydro:

  Pumping and turbining maximum powers for the week, generated by
  `get_max_hydro`

- week:

  Current week for which to compute controls

## Value

List of constraint values for the week

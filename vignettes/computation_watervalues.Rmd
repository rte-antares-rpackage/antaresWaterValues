## How does it work ?

To understand how the package works, the user needs to understand what are water values and how to calculate them in theory. After that, they will able to understand the method used to calculate water values with Antares.

### Theory

#### Why do we need water values ?

Antares solves week by week the annual unit commitment problem. When long term water reservoirs are used in Antares, a procedure is needed to determine which amount of water Antares should use for a given week and which amount Antares should keep for the rest of the year. One method to do so is to use water values.

#### What are water values ?

Water values are prices in euros per MWh that helps Antares, in his weekly sequentially resolution, to determine whether to use the water stocked in reservoirs during the current week or to keep it for later in the year. There is one value per reservoir per week and per reservoir level. Water values are comparable to marginal prices of thermal units. A simple criterion to understand water values is the following :

-   During an hour, if the marginal price is greater than the water value, it's better to turbine the water in the reservoir.

-   Otherwise, if the marginal price is lower than the water value multiplied by the pumping efficiency, it's better to pump water into the reservoir, if pumping is possible.

These water values are defined by the user so they needs a method to calculate them.

#### How to calculate water values ?

Water values are the derivatives of Bellman values. Bellman values are given, alike water values, for each reservoir, each week and each reservoir level. They represent the future gains in euros that are possible to make with the amount of water stocked in the reservoir. They are supposed to be concave for a given week. In consequence, water values are supposed to be decreasing for a given week, which you can see on the images above, and this is, in fact, one strong assumption of Antares.

#### How to calculate Bellman values ?

To calculate Bellman values, one needs to solve the following optimization problem by dynamic programming. This means that one begins by solving the problem by the last week of the year and then one solves the precedent week through backtracking.

$$
V_t(X_t) = \max_{U \in [U^{min},U^{max}],X_{t+1}=X_t-U_t+I_t,X_{t+1} \in [X_{t+1}^{min},X_{t+1}^{max}]} G_t(X_t,U_t,W_t) + V_{t+1}(X_{t+1})
$$

We use the following notations :

-   $t \in [1,T]$ representing the weeks of the year.

-   $V_t(X_t)$ is the Bellman value for week $t$ and for the reservoir level at the beginning of week $t$ $X_t$.

-   $V_{T+1}(X_{T+1}) = K(X_{T+1})$ is the Bellman value at the end of the year that is supposed to be known.

-   $U_t$ is the amount of water destocked ($>0$) or pumped ($<0$) with extreme values $U^{min}$ and $U^{max}$. It is also called the control.

-   $I_t$ is the inflow during week $t$.

-   $[X_t^{min},X_t^{max}]$ are the rule curves for the beginning of week $t$.

-   $G_t(X_t,U_t,W_t)$ is the reward during week $t$ depending on the hazards $W_t$ that comprise the inflow. Hazards are represented by Monte Carlo years in Antares.

This equation means that the gain that is possible to make between the beginning of week $t$ and the end of the year is the best compromise between the gain at week $t$ and the gain between the beginning of week $t+1$ and the end of the year. In other words, it is the best compromise between using water during week $t$ and keeping it for the other weeks.

### Practice

There are three main steps to calculate water values in this package using Antares :

1.  Calculate rewards functions $G_t(X_t,U_t,W_t)$ for all weeks and all possible hazards.

2.  Apply the precedent equation to calculate Bellman values.

3.  Calculate the derivative of Bellman values to get water values.

Each step is detailed is the following paragraphs.

#### Rewards functions

First of all, we assume that the reward $G_t(X_t,U_t,W_t)$ doesn't depend on the reservoir level $X_t$.

In the simulation tab, the user chooses a set of controls for which the reward function will be evaluated. There is the same number of controls for each week but the value of the controls can change if the maximum power of the turbine varies between weeks. For each control, a complete Antares simulation is launched, IE for all weeks and all Monte Carlo years. This means there is exactly one simulation per control. To force the control of the reservoir during a given simulation, the reservoir is deactivated, fictive areas are created and a biding constraint is added.

One all simulations are run, in the "calculate water values" tab, the user can choose to estimate the reward function for more controls than the ones used in simulation. Indeed, the user can choose to use marginal prices to interpolate reward functions. The idea behind this method is to use hourly marginal prices of each simulation to estimate the reward one could make by slightly changing the control for which the simulation was run. The user has to choose a number of hours that corresponds to the level of discretization of the hourly marginal prices kept to interpolate and a number of controls for which the estimation of the reward function will be calculated. This method is a little time consuming but if it is used, less Antares simulations are needed and the reward functions will necessary be concave. In case the user doesn't choose this method, they can choose to correct the monotony of the reward functions which is an expected feature. Then, in both cases, whether marginal prices are been used to interpolate or not, during the dynamic programming phase, if the algorithm needs a reward for a control that hasn't been evaluated, it uses linear interpolation between controls.

#### Calculation of Bellman values

Using reward functions, one can now calculate Bellman values. The package uses discretization of reservoir levels (number of states) to do so. The user has to define the initial value of Bellman values for week 53. To eliminate the edge effect of this initial value, we recommend to caculate 2 cycles of Bellman values. The user can also choose to iterate the calculation of Bellman values until convergence. The user also choose the way they want to handle The different Bellman values for the different Monte Carlo years. They can choose to mean them at the end of each week calculation (recommended, grid-mean) or at the end of the algorithm (mean-grid). The user has to define penalty for not respecting rule curves. It is possible to correct concavity of Bellman values to ensure that water values will be decreasing. This isn't necessary if marginal prices have been used to interpolate reward functions.

#### Calculation of water values

This last step is very simple. The package interpolates Bellman values to have a step of discretization of 1% and then calculates the derivative of Bellman values to have one value per reservoir level and per day (water values are constant for a given week).
